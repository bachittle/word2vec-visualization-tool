# word2vec visualization tool

A 2d/3d visualization tool for word2vec, made as a fun 
personal project to see how one can visualize vector 
representations of words. 


Uses Google's word2vec C code as a baseline, I am using my 
forked branch as reference (and updating that branch as I 
see fit, for my own learning). You can check that out here:
